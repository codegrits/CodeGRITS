[CodeGRITS](https://codegrits.github.io/CodeGRITS/) stands for **G**aze **R**ecording & **I**DE **T**racking **S**ystem. It's a plugin developed by the [SaNDwich Lab](https://toby.li/) and is specially designed for empirical software engineering researchers. CodeGRITS is built on top of [IntelliJ Platform SDK](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/welcome.html), with wide compatibility with the entire family of [JetBrains IDEs](https://www.jetbrains.com/) and [Tobii eye-tracking devices](https://www.tobii.com/), to track developers‚Äô IDE interactions and eye gaze data.

The [website](https://codegrits.github.io/CodeGRITS/)'s source code is stored in the `./site` folder of this repository and deployed via GitHub Pages. The [JavaDoc](https://codegrits.github.io/CodeGRITS/docs/index.html) documentation is located in the `./site/docs` folder of this repository. They are archived together with the source code in the Software Heritage for long-term preservation.

The data collected by CodeGRITS can be used by empirical SE researchers to understand the behaviors of developers, especially those related to eye gaze. CodeGRITS also provides a [real-time data API](site/developer.md) for future plugin developers and researchers to design context-aware programming support tools.

We provide an example project [DataStreamReceiver](https://github.com/codegrits/DataStreamReceiver) that builds on top of the real-time data API. It is designed to receive the IDE and eye tracking data and directly visualize them in two separate windows.

## Key Features

- :mag: **IDE Tracking**: CodeGRITS tracks developers‚Äô IDE interactions, including mouse clicks, keyboard inputs, etc.
- :eye: **Eye Tracking**: CodeGRITS tracks developers‚Äô eye gaze data from [Tobii eye-tracking devices](https://www.tobii.com/), and maps them to corresponding source code elements.
- :computer: **Screen Recording**: CodeGRITS simultaneously records developers‚Äô screen for visualizing their behaviors.
- üî® **Research Toolkit**: CodeGRITS provides a set of extra features for empirical SE researchers, including dynamic configuration, activity labeling, real-time data API, etc.
- üóÉÔ∏è **Data Export**: CodeGRITS exports data in XML format for further data analysis. See [Data Format](site/data.md) for more details.

### Cross-platform and Multilingual Support

- [x] CodeGRITS provides cross-platform support for Windows, macOS, and Linux, and is expected to be compatible with the entire family of JetBrains IDEs, including IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, etc.
- [x] CodeGRITS could extract the abstract syntax tree (AST) structure of eye gazes on multiple programming languages, as long as the IDE supports them, including Java, Python, C/C++, JavaScript, etc.

CodeGRITS has been primarily developed and tested on Windows and Linux, with only partial testing on macOS. There may be some unnoticed bugs on macOS. We have created a [`mac` branch](https://github.com/codegrits/CodeGRITS/tree/mac) for this and have fixed some known issues. If you encounter additional issues on macOS, please feel free to report them to us.
