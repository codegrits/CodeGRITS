# About

[CodeGRITS](https://codegrits.github.io/CodeGRITS/) is professionally built and supported by a small dedicated team of
HCI and SE researchers from [SaNDwich Lab](https://toby.li/) at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/)
and [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/).
We are committed to keeping CodeGRITS open source and making it beneficial for the community.

The authors of CodeGRITS are [Ningzhi Tang](https://nztang.com/) (equal contribution),
[Junwen An](https://wanteatfruit.github.io/) (equal contribution),
[Meng Chen](https://casardo-chen.github.io/), [Aakash Bansal](https://aakashba.github.io/),
[Yu Huang](https://yuhuang-lab.github.io/), [Collin McMillan](https://sdf.org/~cmc/),
and [Toby Jia-Jun Li](https://toby.li/). Technical support questions, bug reports, and feature requests are best started
as a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/codegrits/CodeGRITS/issues).

CodeGRITS has won the **Artifact Available** and **Artifact Evaluated** badges at
[ICSE 2024](https://conf.researchr.org/details/icse-2024/icse-2024-artifact-evaluation/49/CodeGRITS-A-Research-Toolkit-for-Developer-Behavior-and-Eye-Tracking-in-IDE)
for its commitment to reproducibility! Please check its details in the [ICSE24-AE](https://github.com/codegrits/ICSE24-AE) repository.

We prepared a video demonstration of CodeGRITS for ICSE 2024.

## Credits

CodeGRITS would not be possible without the following commercial and open-source projects:

- [IntelliJ Platform SDK](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/welcome.html): CodeGRITS is built on top of the
  IntelliJ Platform.
- [Tobii Pro SDK](https://www.tobii.com/products/software/applications-and-developer-kits/tobii-pro-sdk/): CodeGRITS
  uses the Tobii Pro SDK to collect eye gaze data from Tobii eye-tracking devices.
- [ReType](https://retype.com/): CodeGRITS documentation is built with Retype.
- [JavaCV](http://bytedeco.org/): CodeGRITS uses JavaCV to implement the screen recorder.

Special thanks to the [iTrace](https://www.i-trace.org/) team. iTrace is a similar tool to CodeGRITS for collecting
developers' eye gaze data in several IDEs, including Eclipse, Visual Studio, and Atom. We have learned a lot from their
work and referred to part of their code. Different from iTrace, CodeGRITS is built for JetBrains IDEs and provides a
set of extra functionalities (e.g., IDE tracking, screen recording, etc.) for empirical SE researchers.
